## üíé Overview  

**Firestorm CAD** is a professional **3D jewelry design software** built for artisans, designers, and manufacturers seeking both precision and creative flexibility. It combines the accuracy of traditional CAD systems with modern artistic tools, making it possible to design intricate jewelry pieces that are ready for production.  

The platform is powered by a **parametric modeling engine**, allowing designers to adjust dimensions, gem settings, and shapes in real time. This non-destructive workflow makes it easy to refine models without having to restart from scratch. With **specialized jewelry modules**, users can create rings, pendants, earrings, and custom pieces tailored to client needs.  

**Firestorm CAD** also includes a high-performance **rendering engine** for producing lifelike visualizations of metals, gems, and textures. It supports a full production pipeline ‚Äî from concept sketching and modeling to 3D printing and casting preparation.  

Developed with performance and efficiency in mind, Firestorm CAD is optimized for macOS, offering a smooth design experience on both Intel and Apple Silicon systems.
